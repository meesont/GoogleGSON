# GoogleGSON
Using Google's GSON for persistent storage of objects, this was created for an experiment in order to conclude whether JSON 
would be a valid solution to flatfile storage for my upcoming projects.

Other options do exist:
* H2 Storage
* SQLite
* MySQL (JDBC)
* Redis (Jedis)
* MongoDB
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* YAML
